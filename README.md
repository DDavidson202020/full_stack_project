## Description
Book Logger is an application where members can log in to find books by title or author's name. The page will give them a list of books, each book has a small image of the book, title and author's name, some description about the book. They can add their favorite books to the list on their profile. We want to build more features for the application, because of  time scope, so we couldn't add all the features we want where members can.....
## Technologies
This application is run on Node with express, mysql2 and sequelize. We use Bulma framework for styling. It's deployed on Heroku.
