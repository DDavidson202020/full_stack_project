## Description
Book Logger is an application where members can log in to find books by title or author's name. The page will give them a list of books, each book has a small image of the book, title and author's name, some description about the book. They can add their favorite books to the list on their profile. We want to build more features for the application, because of  time scope, so we couldn't add all the features we want where members can search books by genre, trade books, add to different lists. We also want to use Goodreads API to add reviews on the page, and reward members with stickers for how many pages they've read. We'll come back to work on all these functionalities when we have time to make our app unique and professional.
## Technologies
This application is run on Node with express, mysql2 and sequelize. We use Bulma framework for styling. It's deployed on Heroku.
